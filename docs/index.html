          <h2 class='h2 center big light mid-gray mb3'>Project Documentation</h2>

          <p class='m0 mt3 px2 py2 center bl rounded shadow'>All the code for this project is available at <a class='link' href='https://github.com/bentranter/course-notes'>github.com/bentranter/course-notes</a></p>

          <h2 class='h2 big light gray mb2'>Introduction</h2>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='about'>A High-Level Description</a></h3>
          <p>StudyPiggy can be summed up as, <span class='italic'>"the way to get straight A's studying for three minutes a day"</span>. StudyPiggy aims to enable students to be able to spend around three minutes/day studying, while retaining between 89% and 92% of the content in their notes (see the <a href='http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm'>SM-2</a> algorithm for more information about this claim). StudyPiggy combines two modern approaches to speeding up learning: <span class='bold'>speed reading and spaced repetition</span>.</p>
          <p>From a technical perspective, StudyPiggy aims to be an extremely lean service. That means, blazingly fast load times, as-small-as-possible codebase, modular design pattterns, simple architecture, and small data footprint, and significant latency compensation on the front-end. Since we're essentially a service that stores text via a REST API, we can create an architecture that is extremely efficient, both in terms of cost and bandwidth.</p>
          <p>StudyPiggy is a basic text editor, with a pop up speed reader and a servie on the server that keeps track of how often a user has reviewed their notes, and when they should review their notes next. We figured that StudyPiggy would only be truly useful if it had maximum usability, so a lot of effort has gone into making the service as easy and quick-to-use as possible.</p>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='gettingstarted'>Getting Started</a></h3>
          <p class='small bg-red white py1 px1 rounded'>WARNING: Only run this on Windows if you are very brave! While this <span class='italic'>will</span> run on Windows, it is designed to run on Mac OS X or Linux.</p>
          <p>Before installing and running this application, you'll need to have a few things installed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported, comes installed by default on Mac OS X and Linux)</li>
            <li>A C++ compiler (both Clang and GCC will work)</li>
            <li>Node.js v10.xx or io.js (you can install that <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>here</a>)</li>
            <li>Git (version control software, install <a href='http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git'>here</a>)</li>
            <li>NPM (this will come installed by default when you install Node.js)</li>
            <li>RethinkDB (you can install that <a href='http://rethinkdb.com/'>here</a>)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='installation'>Installation Instructions</a></h3>
          <p>Once you've downloaded everything listed above, you'll need to run a few commands from your command prompt or terminal. Open a window, and run:</p>
          <pre><code>
  $ rethinkdb
          </code></pre>
          <p>That will start RethinkDB. You can view the RethinkDB admin panel by going to <code>0.0.0.0:8080</code> in your browser.</p>
          <p>Once RethinkDB is running, open a second window in your command prompt or terminal, and run the following commands:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  $ git clone https://github.com/bentranter/course-notes.git
  $ cd course-notes && cd web
  $ npm install
  $ npm start</code>
          </pre>
          <p>This will clone the project's source code from GitHub, install all the project's dependencies, and start the server. If you get errors, make sure RethinkDB is running on your computer somewhere. If you see an error originating from a process called "Node-Gyp", make sure that Python 2.7 is installed on your computer and in your $PATH. If everything is working, you should be able to point your browser to <code>0.0.0.0:3000</code> and see the web UI up and running.</p>
          <p>To run the tests, open a <span class='bold'>third</span> window in your command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the <code>tests</code> directory. Once you're in there, run the command <code>$ jasmine-node .</code> . That will run all the tests automatically, and inform you of any failures.</p>

          <h2 class='h2 big light gray mb2'>Architecture</h2>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='overview'>Overview</a></h3>
          <p>StudyPiggy is multiple client-server application. That means that different clients can connect to the same server. This works by communicating over HTTP via our REST API. As you know, HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Our application sticks to the four main HTTP verbs: <code>GET, POST, PUT and DELETE</code>. As you probably also know, REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol - perfect for a client-server app with multiple clients.</p>
          <p>Our server runs on Node.js, and uses the <a href='http://expressjs.com/'>Express</a> framework as middleware. We use a NoSQL database called RethinkDB to store our data. The web client uses Backbone.js as a framework. The Android app is written in Java, and relies on the Android SDK and OKHttp by Square for handling HTTP requests.</p>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='security'>Security</a></h3>
          <p>For password security, we use a <span class='italic'>one-way hashing algorithm</span> called bcrypt. We also salt each hash. Bcrypt is a nice algorithm, because it takes around two seconds to execute, so it is very strong against brute force and collision attacks.</p>
          <p>We use UUIDs for each database entries' id to enforce uniqueness, no matter what dataset it might be in (the odds of creating two identical UUIDs is approximately one in 17 trillion, given sufficient entropy).</p>
          <p>We use JSON web tokens, and force all communication with the server to be over HTTPS using SSL (to encrypt all traffic). When a user signs up or logs in, they're given a JSON web token that is valid for seven days. They then must send their token with every request to our API. JSON web tokens are 150-character longs strings that are signed and encrypted using a secret that only the server is aware of, so they cannot be decrypted and tampered with by a client.</p>
          <p>Each user's username resides within their token, and the server requests a user's username <span class='italic'>from the token</span>, to ensure that a user can only see their own notes.</p>
          <p>Anytime an operation that is considered to be a security risk occurs (deleting large amounts of notes, changing a password, etc), and email is sent to that user informing them of that action, so that if it was not done by them, they are at least made aware of the particular action.</p>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='endpoints'>API Endpoints</a></h3>
          <p>There are two types of API Endpoints: <span class='bold'>secure</span> and <span class='bold'>insecure</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class='bold'>secure</span> endpoint is one that is protected by our authorization middleware (that is, that endpoint requires a valid token to be sent with the request). An <span class='bold'>insecure</span> endpoint is one that doesn't require a token to be sent with the request.</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>Insecure Endpoints</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><code>/api/signup</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>POST</code>. Allows a user to enter their desired username and password to signup for our service. Returns a valid JSON web token for that username.</li>
            <li><code>/api/login</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>POST</code>. Allows a user to enter their username and password to login to our service. Returns a valid JSON web token for that username.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class='h4'>Secure Endpoints</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><code>/api/notes</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>GET</code> Allows a user to retrieve all their notes.</li>
            <li><code>/api/notes</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>POST</code> Allows a user to create a new note. Returns the note created.</li>
            <li><code>/api/notes/:id</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>GET</code> Allows a user to retrieve a single note by id.</li>
            <li><code>/api/notes/:id</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>PUT</code> Allows a user to update or change a single note by id.</li>
            <li><code>/api/notes/:id</code> - <span class='bold'>HTTP method:</span> <code>DELETE</code> Allows a user to delete a single note by id.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class='h4'>Making a Request</h4>
          <p>A sample POST request would look something like this:</p>
          <pre><code>
  POST /api/signup HTTP/1.1
  Host: studyfast.com
  Cache-Control: no-cache
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  username=YourUserName&password=YourPassword
          </code></pre>
          <p>You <span class='bold'>must</span> specify that the content-type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded when you make a POST or PUT request, otherwise the request will fail.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned above, when you make a request to a secure endpoint, you must include your token. A token can be send in three different ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>As an <code>X-Access-Token</code> in the request header.</li>
            <li>As an <code>accessToken</code> in the request body.</li>
            <li>As an <code>accessToken</code> in the URL parameters, for example: <code>/api/notes?accessToken=yoursupercrazylongtoken</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='models'>Data Models</a></h3>
          <p>As of right now, our data models are simple:</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>User</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>username: String</li>
            <li>password: String</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class='h4'>Notes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>title: String</li>
            <li>subtitle: String</li>
            <li>content: String</li>
            <li>folder: String</li>
            <li>dateCreated: Date</li>
            <li>dateUpdated: Date</li>
            <li>timesReviewed: Number</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class='h3'><a name='oopandroid'>Android Architecture</a></h3>
          <h4 class='h4'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>The mobile application stores files from the server onto the mobile device. It requires the server to respond with a JSON Object token when a login is requested. It also requires the server to respond with a JSON Object containing all of the users documents stored on the server when a request containing the token is sent to the server. The mobile application must be able to form the POST and GET requests sent to the server, as well as deal with the response from the server or any error that occurs. It must have the ability to access all of the files that have been taken from the server and stored locally.</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>General Priorities</h4>
          <p>The main priority of the application is that it be easy to use for the user. This includes having the application respond in a way that the user would expect when the user interacts with it. The user should be able to easily navigate their way through the application. This also includes not giving a user the opportunity to break the application. The application is also designed to be easily expanded as well as to be easily maintained, handling changes on the server side.  The classes for updating and logging in should be designed in a way that allows the application to do more tasks with the information it receives from the server.</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>Major Architecture Issues</h4>
          <p>One design issue was in what way to deal with the information coming in from the server, and how to store both the content from each document as well as the data related to each document such as its id, date last modified, etc. One solution was to store the incoming data as a String, then parse through the String and create a bunch of ArrayLists containing all the information. One issue with this was that the characters used to separate the information could also be part of the information, which left a possibility of errors in the parsing. One possible solution to this problem was using regular expressions and lexically parsing through, but a much simpler solution was to just store the information from the server as an array of JSON objects, and create new JSON objects to store locally containing the information that needed to be stored.</p>
          <p>Another design issue was setting up menus and changing menus depending on if the user logs in, or if an update fails, etc. This was an issue because networking tasks must be run asynchronously from the UI thread, and retrieving a response was less then intuitive. The solution was to create a singleton of global variables, then on any activity that could modify the menu bar, set a variable telling the application to wait and see if the menu needs to be change, and have the networking tasks set a variable indicating if the menu needs to be changed or not, and to stop waiting.</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>Details of the Architecture</h4>
          <p>The application uses a REST API to make requests to the server. The requests are formed by an OkHttpClient, open source software by Squareup. The response is a JSON object. Doing a POST request with a valid username and password to the server login will return a token, token expiration date and the username. These, along with the password sent in the request, are saved in the applications key-value storage. Sending an GET request to the servers notes endpoint along with a valid token will reply with all of the users documents on the server.</p>
          <p>Once the client has received all the documents from the server, it compares their lastModified date with the lastModified date of the documents saved locally. For each file from the server that has been updated more recently, the local version of the document will be rewritten with the content of the document from the server. The file containing information about the documents its then updated to reflect these changes.</p>
          <h3 class='h4'>Object Oriented Description</h3>
          <p>The Singleton GlobalApp is accessible by every activity within the application, and holds information that needs to be passed between multiple activities as well as function and values used by different activities.</p>
          <p>The application first launches the activity AppLaunch. If this is the first time it is run, it will start a notification updating system that will send notifications to the device every hour indicating how many reviews there are to be completed. AppLaunch will determine if a login is required, and move the application to the correct screen accordingly. If no login is needeed, the MainActivity activity will be loaded.</p>
          <p>Every hour, StartNotification will be started which will count the number of reviews that need to done, and send a notification to the device displaying this information.</p>
          <p>The LoginScreen activity lets the user input their username and password, and then starts the MainActivity, telling it to get a token from the server.</p>
          <p>The MainActivity makes calls to Login and Update. These methods will either do their job with no notification, or prompt an error if one occurs. When the user selects an action that could cause the menu to be updated, the activity will wait for a global variable to change that indicates if a change in the menu should occur. When the user selects Login the application launches the LoginScreen activity. If Logout is selected, the application will delete the stored username, password, token and tokenExpiration and launch the LoginScreen activity.</p>
          <p>MainActivity has 2 tabs, which switch between displaying LocalFilesBrowser and CardTypeTwo.</p>
          <p>CardTypeTwo simply displays flip cards from the cards that need to be reviewed, allowing the user to answer if they knew the correct response or not. Once all of the cards are answered correctly, the app shows that the review is completed.</p>
          <p>The LocalFileBrowser starts with the user viewing the root directory, and when the user selects a folder, the selected Folder is set to that folder, and the user is show all the folders and documents in the folders leading up to the selected folder. Each item in the list also has a color associated to it that ranges from green to red. This color represents the color of the document within the folder that most needs to be reviewed. When a document is selected, this will launch the DocumentLoader, passing it the document that needs to be loaded. LocalFileBrowser makes use of CustomListAdapter which is what allows the colored circles to be show on each list element.</p>
          <p>DocumentLoader is a container activity that will display either the DisplayDocument activity, the SpeedReader activity or the CardTypeOne activity. The displayed activity is changed by changing the tab.</p>
          <p>DisplayDocument simply displays the entire document as text.</p>
          <p>SpeedReader is the speed reading application where the text is quickly scrolled through, with an adjustable speed.</p>
          <p>CardTypeOne is similar to CardTypeTwo but instead of going through all the reviews, it will go through all the cards contained in the currently selected document.</p>

          <p class='m0 mt3 px2 py2 center bl rounded shadow'>Please see the <a href='/pdf/uml.pdf'>UML</a> and <a href='/pdf/usecase.pdf'>use case diagram</a> (both are PDF files).</p>

          <h2 class='h2 big light'>Use Cases</h2>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='usecaseweb'>Web</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Signing up: the user scrolls through the landing page, enters their email and password in the signup field, and hits submit. The page sends an AJAX to the server, checks to see if that email is available (the primary key for users in their email, so they must be unique), and returns a message to the user. During this screen, the entire application code is cached in the browser's AppCache, so that the user doesn't have to wait for the server to load the entire app when the application loads up for the first time.</li>
            <li>The user clicks a link in the success message after signing up, and is taken to the application. They're prompted to create a new note.</li>
            <li>The user enters a title, folder name, and can then write the content of their note.</li>
            <li>The user can save a note by clicking the save button. An AJAX request is sent to the server, but the UI changes to show that the note was saved before the server responds (to compensate for latency).</li>
            <li>A user can update notes, and delete notes. The same latency compensation technique is used.</li>
            <li>A user can speedread their notes by clicking the speedread button. A popup appears with speed controls, a stop/start button, and a finish button.</li>
            <li>A user can speedread a note by clicking the start button in the popup.</li>
            <li>A user can update the total count of how many times they've reviewed the note by clicking the finish button. An AJAX requets is sent to the server to update the count.</li>
            <li>A user can logout by clicking the logout button.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='usecaseserver'>Server</a></h3>
            <p>The server only serves two purposes: responding to HTTP requests, and generating tokens for security. The user cannot interact directly with anything on the server, and all server methods are called through the REST API.</p>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='usecaseandroid'>Android</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The user starts with the option to login or to stay logged out. If the user chooses to login they will be able to sync their documents with those saved on the server, as well as log out whenever wanted. They will never be automatically logged out. If they choose to stay logged out, they can login at any time.</li>
            <li>Users can choose to delete all documents saved on the device.</li>
            <li>The user can select the "Reviews" tab which will allow them to do their overdue reviews.</li>
            <li>When doing reviews, the user is shown the front of the card and is given a reveal button, when the reveal button is pressed, the back side of the card is show, and they are given buttons indicating how well they knew the answer. One selecting a button, a new card is shown.</li>
            <li>The user is shown a file browser and is able to browse for and select a document. There is colored circle shown on each folder and document indicating if the folder contains a document that needs to be reviewed, or if the document itself needs to be reviewed. The color ranges from red to green.</li>
            <li>Once a document is selected, the user is shown the text in the document, and given the option to browse the document in the speed reader or to do the flip cards for the document.</li>
            <li>On the speed reader, the user is shown ~10 characters at a time which scroll through the words in the text. The user can adjust the speed, and press a button to pause and resume the speed reader.</li>
            <li>If the flip cards are selected, the user will be able to review all the flip cards for the selected document.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class='h2 big light'>Design</h2>
          <h3 class='h3'><a name='server'>Server</a></h3>
          <p>The server has an extremely simple design. Essentially, it is two files: one with some startup code for the server that handles the database connection, which port to serve on, the API endpoint names, and whether to enable development mode or production mode, and the other handles the server's application logic.</p>
          <p>The application consists of the model schemas, the authentication middleware, and the request/response handling for the API endpoints. There are two schemas: one for the <span class='italic'>user</span> and one for the <span class='italic'>notes</span>.</p>
          <p>The primary key for the user is the username. The primary key for the notes is the id. A user has a one-to-many relationship with the notes (relations in a NoSQL database? Weird, I know, but it speeds up our queries massively).</p>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='client'>Web Client</a></h3>
          <p>Our web client is currently under development and is at best, a huge mess. We use an MVC approach, and complete documentation will be added once more progress is made on the web client.</p>

          <h3 class='h3'><a name='android'>Android Client</a></h3>
          <p>Each Activity (screen / task of the application) is defined as a class. When something on the screen is tapped, such as a button or dragging a bar, a method in the class will be called.</p>
          <p>StudyPiggy launches into the class AppLaunch, where it will check to see if the users username and password are stored. If they are not, it will launch the login screen. If the username and password are found, it will check to see if the token used to authenticate with the server needs to be updated. This includes checking if the token exists, and if the token is not expired. If it fails one of these checks, then the MainActivity will get launched with the instruction to attempt login with the stored credentials. If the token makes it through the checks, the MainActivity will launch with the instruction to update the locally stored files, using the stored token.</p>
          <p>The LoginScreen has 2 buttons: "Login" and "Continue without Login" which correspond to the methods "login" and "skipLogin" in the LoginScreen class. Tapping one of these button will call the corresponding method, and either launch MainActivity with the instruction to not login, or to attempt login with the entered username and password.</p>
          <p>The MainActivity makes calls to Login and Update. These methods will either do their job with no notification, or prompt an error if one occurs. When the user selects an action that could cause the menu to be updated, the activity will wait for a global variable to change that indicates if a change in the menu should occur. When the user selects Login the application launches the LoginScreen activity. If Logout is selected, the application will delete the stored username, password, token and tokenExpiration and launch the LoginScreen activity. Tapping on the "Open Local Files Browser" button will call the method openLocalFileBrowser, which launches the LocalFilesBrowser Activity.</p>
          <p>The LocalFilesBrowser finds all the folders and documents in the root of the application storage and sorts them, with folders dislaying before documents, then sorted alphabetically. Selecting a folder will launch another instance of LocalFilesBrowser, displaying the folders and documents inside the selected folder. Selecing a Document will launch DocumentLoader, passing it the data from the document as a string.</p>
          <p>The DocumentLoader will create 2 tabs, one responsible for displaying the entire content of the document, and one responsible for displaying the speed reader activity. Selecting a tab launches a new instance of the activity corresponding to the tab. When the activity being displayed is DisplayDocument, it will display the full data as plaintext. If the data extends below the screen, the user can slide their finger up the screen to make it scroll down.</p>
          <p>On the SpeedReader Activity, the buttons on the screen call the methods moveBar, slowDown, SpeedUp, startPauseOrResume depending on the button tapped. These control how the text is rotated through on the screen.</p>
          <p>The Login and Updates Classes are called asynchronously by MainActivity. Both of them Set global variables as well as store information that is used by the application. They make use of the Error class to store errors received from the attempting communication with the server. This Error is used in determining if the MainActivity should be prompted with an Error such as "invalid login information".</p>
          <p>Global variables are passed around by the Singleton GlobalApp.</p>
          <h4 class='h4'>Functionality Implemented and Shown in Demo</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Application automatically loads to either the login screen, or the main activity depending on if login information has been saved.</li>
            <li>'Continue without Login' on the login page will bring the application to the main activity correctly.</li>
            <li>'Login' on the login page will launch main activity telling it to login using the entered information.</li>
            <li>The Correct menu loads on Main Activity, and correctly changes after login and logout.</li>
            <li>Selecing 'Login' menu in main activity correctly brings up the login activity.</li>
            <li>Selecing 'Logout' menu in main activity correctly brings up the login activity.</li>
            <li>Selecting 'Clear Memory' deletes all the files from the device, and they no longer appear in the file browser.</li>
            <li>Selecting 'Check For Reviews' updates the list of reviews to do, and we see the count of reviews change on the review tab title.</li>
            <li>After 'Login' has been selected on the login activity, the application will attempt to login to the server with the credentials the user entered, then saving the token, token expiration date and login credentials locally if successful.</li>
            <li>Selecing 'Update' from the menu attempts to retrieve user information from the server using the stored token, then compare against locally stored files and update required files. Will prompt if an error occurs.</li>
            <li>Logging out and then logging in as another user allows files from both users to be browsed, but only files from the currently logged in user will be updated.</li>
            <li>The file browser is correctly displayed along with the color for each folder and file. Reviewing an item and then reloading the file browser will set the color of the reviewed document to green, showing that it does not need to be reviewed right away.</li>
            <li>Can easily switch between the Review tab and the File Browser tab.</li>
            <li>Doing reviews on the review tab updates the indicator showing the renaming number of tabs to do.</li>
            <li>Correctly Answering a review increases the time until it needs to be completed again.</li>
            <li>Selecting a document in the file browser will open the document in the document loader.</li>
            <li>In the document loader, tabs can be selected to either just show the document as text, open the speed reader and open the card viewer.</li>
            <li>When the document is shown as text, it is cleaned so that extra tags such as new line tags are not shown.</li>
            <li>In the speed reader, the text is properly separated into words and only a few words are displayed at a time. The pause and resume button works, and the slider bar to adjust speed works. The document correctly pauses the speed reader at places where there would be a new line in the document.</li>
            <li>When the flip card tab is selected the user can review the cards associated with the selected document, but this will not update their level or the current review list.</li>
            <li>Show that adding documents or editing documents on the server will be synced correctly on the device the next time that it syncs with the server.</li>
